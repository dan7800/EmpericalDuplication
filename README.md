# EmpericalDuplication
Bug reports are important during software development and maintenance process as they provide relevant information that help developers to fix software defects. 
One of the challenges involved in the use of bug trackers is the bug report duplication problem. This is important because the triager needs to spend time in analyzing the bug and identifying if it has been previously reported which ultimately increase the cost of Software Maintenance. In view of this need, this paper focuses on replicate of [Aggarwal et al.](https://bitbucket.org/kaggarwal32/bug-deduping-dataset) study to validate whether the results hold true using recent datasets.
